First, garbage collection is how the system manages memory. C++ does not use garbage collection and programmers will have to delete pointers manually. Modern C++ has a new pointer system called smart pointers that delete on their own. However, casual C++ programmers or programmers that code in C++ 11 would not have this luxury. Python on the other hand has Garbage collection and deletes unused objects when ever the program needs to make more space. Unfortunately, I did not create objects on my python code. My python code is procedural while my C++ code is object oriented. 
 
Second, the typing of the two languages is different. When you read my python code you will see no type specifier. EX: flag = True. In C++ I would have to write bool flag = true. This is because python is dynamically typed, and C++ is statically typed. And unfortunately, in my experience writing python, this leads me to make more errors in my code. 
 
Third, python uses an interpreter and C++ is pre-compiled. And therefore, python is slower than in execution time compared to C++ because python code needs to be interpreted. Python still has a compiler, but it has less work to do because of the interpreter. Speed is not everything though. Python using an interpreter has the advantage of using less memory compared to C++.
 
Conclusion, Python and C++ are different in many ways. If your program needs to execute fast, you will want C++. If you want simple easy to read/write code, you will want to consider Python. If you like to deallocate your pointers, C++ is your choice. If you always forget to add curly brackets in your code, Python will be a good choice because python recognizes its code blocks by the indented lines(example in code). Both are great languages and have their own uses and strengths.  I had fun doing this project and I wish more classes had use compare languages like this class did. It was a joyful experience!
