 First, garbage collection is how the system manages memory. C++ does not use garbage collection and programmers will have to delete pointers manually. Modern C++ has a new pointer system called smart pointers than delete on their own. However, casual C++ programmers or programmers that code in C++ 11 would not have this luxury. Python on the other hand has Garbage collection and deletes unused objects when ever the program needs to make more space. Unfortunately, I did not create objects on my python code. My python code is procedural while my C++ code is object oriented. Secondly, the typing of the two languages is different. When you read my python code you will see no type specifier. EX: flag = True. In C++ I would have to write bool flag = true. This is because python is dynamically typed, and C++ is statically typed. Lastly, python uses an interpreter and C++ is pre-compiled. And therefore, python is slower than in execution time compared to C++ because python code needs to be interpreted.
